# Overview <a name="Overview"></a>
Welcome to the world of Credit Cards! This document is to support you in your journey of maximizing benefits from whenever you spend money day to day to maximizing rewards from the big purchase you have from time to time. These rewards and perks are meant to supplement your spending that you already plan to do and not meant for you to spend money just to get the rewards.

Another way of maximizing benefits even more is to churn credit cards, meaning they repeatedly open new cards to earn rewards (usually signup bonuses or SUBs) to accumulate points or cashback in a short period of time. They then use these points on big purchases (usually travel) where the points are worth a little more depending on how you redeem them. For example, with Chase, one can get 1.2x – 1.8x per point on redemption. For expensive purchases (< $3,000) I recommend business cards.

However, for those who find it tiresome to keep track of rewards, you can always simplify with 2-3 cards and stay within an ecosystem. Chase or Capital One, in my opinion, is the go-to for this. Review the remarks on both pages to see why. I recommend one travel card, a rewards credit card, and a catch-all (all other purchases) card.
As you navigate through each page, eyeing the benefits and rewards of what’s out there you’ll come across SUBs. When it comes to SUBs, unless listed, they’ve usually had higher offerings in the past. Traditionally each year there’s a period when there’s an elevated SUB. For example, the Chase Amazon Prime card goes from $100 gift card to $200 gift card upon activation through Prime Day. Being patient will reap you even more rewards in the short term. 

After your first SUB redemption, it can take up to 24 – 48 months for you to qualify for that SUB again. For example, if I qualify and get a SUB for the Chase Sapphire Preferred. I must wait 48 months until I qualify for it again. I will also have to cancel the card as I can’t be a card holder to qualify. So, some Churners may get the Sapphire Preferred, get the SUB, use it for 3 years and 11 months. Cancel it, and then get it again after 4 years to get the SUB again.

I recommend starting with Capital One and Chase first as they are the pickiest and go from there. Building a strong wallet for cash back is rewarding, though takes time. If you don’t have a credit profile, or your profile is thin, (meaning not much credit history), Discover has always been the go-to for one’s first card. They’re super liberal when it comes to new users and the Discover It Cashback has decent rewards.

I hope this guide helps you navigate yourself to maximizing cash back. 

# Terms <a name="Terms"></a>
Throughout this guide, we'll be using terms and abbreviations, here's a list of them:

* Cashback: Direct money that goes back into your pocket. Usually this is redeemed when you pay your statement balance or can be redeemed separately. It’s worth noting that some companies require you to have a minimum number of points to redeem cash back or require you to do so in increments of certain amounts.
* Points/Miles: These are more flexible than cashback. While you can redeem these similar to cashback, you can also redeem these for other awards including but not limited to products (like AirPods), gift cards, travel points, etc. A lot of the times, you can maximize points to supplement travel. We’ll dive into how later.
* Credit Score: This is a prediction of how likely you’re going to repay loans. That’s essentially what credit is, a loan of money that we promise to pay back. We use 3 bureaus to track your credit score: Equifax, Experian, and Transunion. Each of these companies calculates your credit score a little differently and sometimes opening a loan or a card will only report on one while not the other. The max score is 850.
* Hard Pull: Is a direct report to your credit bureau that you’re opening a new card, loan, mortgage, etc. These affect your score directly. 
* Soft Pull:  Is like a hard pull, but don’t affect your credit score. Usually these are used to check if you preapprove for a card.
* Billing Statement: A track of how much your account activity over a period of time.
* Billing Cycle: Usually a one-month period between your billing statements.
* Annual Fee (AF): Fee charged annually to use a card. 
* Foreign Transaction Fee (FTF): Fee issued when you use the card with a foreign currency or a foreign bank.
* Annual Percentage Rate (APR): Yearly interest rate you pay to borrow money. 
* Signup Bonuses (SUBs): Bonus cash or points that you receive for reaching a certain spend amount with a card within a certain period (usually within 60-90 days of opening).
* Authorized User (AU): A user that gets their own card that shares the credit of the account of main cardholder. The AU will receive some of the benefits the cardholder does, depending on what the credit company decides.
* Deragotory Mark: A report to your credit bureau that’s unfavorable such as a late or missed payment, foreclosures, bankruptcy, etc.

# What Are Credit Cards? <a name="WhatAreCreditCards"></a>

## What is Credit?
Credit is an agreement between a lender (usually a bank or credit union) and a borrower that allows the borrower to receive goods or services before paying for them with a promise to pay back the lender in the future. In most cases repayment includes interest on return. Credit can also refer to your history of borrowing and repayment. 
Your Credit Score is a number that predicts how likely you’re to repay a loan on time based on your credit reports. Usually it ranges from 300 – 850. The higher the score, the more you’re likely to be approved to receive credit. This is including, but not limited to credit cards, loans, mortgages, etc. 
Your score is not the only factor in the decision to approve you for credit. Things such as repayment history, number of credit lines open, the amount of outstanding credit you have available all play factors into your approval.

## Statements and APRs
It’s important to understand how statements and APRs work, otherwise you may get riddled with fees, but have no fear, I’m here! It can be quite confusing at first, especially with numbers being thrown all over the place, but here’s how it works.
When you apply for a card, you’re given an APR (an Annual Percentage Rate), which is the yearly percentage cost of borrowing money. Similarly to loans, you’re charged this percentage of your total owed balance. Don’t worry about having a high APR; if you pay back the total statement balance before the due date, you’ll never be charged a fee.
At the end of each billing cycle (the time between closing dates of 2 statements), a statement is issued. This statement is an overview of all the transactions that took place during the billing cycle. You’ll see purchases, refunds, and fees listed, including dates and the merchant’s name or transaction description of the transaction. If you ever see anything suspicious, try to recall the purchase you made on that date. If you’re sure you didn’t make that purchase, contact your bank, let them know of suspicious activity, and they’ll issue you a new card.

After reviewing the statement, you should pay your card right away! You have time until your due date for you to make a payment (usually 1 additional billing cycle). 
* Minimum payments are the least amount of money you must pay
* You should always pay your entire statement balance
* If you only pay the minimum payment, you’ll be charged the APR for the remaining balance until you’re able to pay off the rest of the balance
  
You can pay off your card before the statement is issued, in which case the balance will not be reported to credit bureaus. The reason we want the statement to be issued, and then paid off in full right after is so that it can be reported to credit bureaus. This way credit lenders will see how much you spent and how much you pay off. If you show a strong pattern of spending and payment, your score will go up and remain high. You’ll also see occasional increases in your credit limit on certain cards over time.

Here’s an example: I have a credit card with a $10000 limit with a APR of 24.99%. I’ve got a statement for transactions that took place between July 15th and August 14th. The bank issues me a statement on August 15th for this statement. On this statement, I have a minimum payment of $40 and a statement balance of $1200. My payment is due by the end of the next billing cycle, September 14th. 

* If I don’t make any payment, I’ll have a late fee and the APR applied to my balance so now I owe the bank ($12000 *1.2499) + late fee. This continues to add up over time until I can repay the balance. If this happens, I’ll also receive a derogatory mark on my credit report.
* If I only pay the minimum balance, you’ll have to pay more with the interest. ($1200 – 40) * 1.2499
* If I pay the balance in full, all $1200, I won’t owe anything in fees.
  
As you can see, there’s no need to worry about the APR and fees as long as everything is paid in full.
